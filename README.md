# Prothentify

A product authentication system to reduce the circulation of fake product items.

## Installation

Install IPFS client and initialize IPFS Daemon process.

Install dependencies of both front-end and back-end modules.

```bash
npm install
```

## Problem Statement

Nowadays we are depending more and more on e-commercial websites and trusting whether they would deliver us authentic products, but there is no way to determine whether the delivered product is fake or not.

We are proposing a system to determine the authenticity of a delivered product.
